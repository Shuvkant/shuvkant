            Mothers are the most beautiful gift one can ever get. They are the most worthy people in our lives. My mom
            is the dearest person in my life. She is so loveable that she appears to be smiling. She doesn'tÂ 
            think about herself, but she remains hungry and gives her food to their children. Really, mothers are great.
            Whenever I sit near her, she smiles first, and if it is time to get food, she asks whether I have taken food
            or not. Whenever I come back from somewhere or I keep on using my computer, she comes to me and asks whether
            I have eaten or not. This is the love of a mother for her children. She can remain hungry, but she will feed
            her children. My mom is of the older generation. She does not understand about today's gadgets like mobile
            phones and laptops, or about the video contents too, like films, but she gets so happy to watch them.
            Whenever I play something, whether it be comedy videos, films, or cartoons, she loves to watch it. When I
            look at her, I see her smiling. She is so happy. Her laugh is so adorable. My mom and dad are so loving.
            They fight as well, but not as seriously, just as a joke. And they do it very well. They tease each other,
            laugh, and live happily. They are the best. They spend most of their time together. I love you, Mummy.
